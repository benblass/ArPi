Experimentation of an avalanche beacon dedecting RaspberryPi 2

"Sensor" part of the code generated from gnu-radio Companion. Based on FuncublDongle pro+ SDR.
The Gui part using wxPython module

Main file ArPi.py.
Calibration is done by setting the variables maxscale and minscale.
maxscale: amplitude value from which the scope will show "found"
minscale: amplitude value from wich the scope will not show the marker (should be consistent with the "threshold" value set in the gnuradio flowgraph for burst detection)

Sensing is started in a standalone process, values shared with other threads on a shared ctype.
Gui is a dedicated thread.



So far tested on Debian Jessy / x86, no other platform.
